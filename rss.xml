            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stop Managing Dependencies!</h1><p>Dependencies in Software Development have been an issue since decades and lots of practices have been built to "manage" them, creating an environment that becomes more complicated with longer time-to-market times as dependencies grow (or the product/solution grows).
