Yet, after asking my personal network if they'd share their ideas publicly, one question kept coming up: How will I protect my idea from being stolen? Why does everyone think their ideas will be stolen?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8033b98b8cb7557bbd2eb7e182a268ba08d065f6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't create a sense of urgency, foster a sense of purpose.</h1><p>Trying to create a sense of urgency almost always backfires. I lead software teams. Part of the territory is people (CEOs, stakeholders, customers) wishing we could go faster. I'm often asked - " do you think the team has a strong enough sense of urgency?" or the direct "can you make the team feel a stronger sense of urgency?"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1e10f9d86d6652c8be71121f352b6e0d3eb22d6.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Minimum and Viable - The Corporate Startup</h1><p>Experimental and Mundane Realism The concept of the minimum viable product is now part of the popular lexicon within the lean startup movement. As with most terms that become over-used most people still misunderstand what an MVP really is. Since most people assume "lean" means cheap, they also assume the MVP means "crappy version of future product".</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0939916efbb396fbdd4a77eb24847139d4ad396c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

By now, most of us are well and truly sick of winter, yet winter is far from done, continuing to torture us with nose-freezing temperatures and super short days. Given how unpleasant the weather can be, it makes sense to conclude that the season is only good for ski buffs and hibernation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1aac6112b92b1b264ebce6acfab3009950438943.jpg"></article>]]></description>
