            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Species of Organizations</h1><p>14 April 2016 There are species of organizations just as there are species of animals. Don't mix them up. A bear is not a beaver; one winters in caves, the other in wooden structures they build for themselves. Hospitals are not factories; advertising agencies are not fast food companies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/40b611237ea6ada2e4b11dbb4b14c3e8588167d6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The future of business is that the customer is the labor and the capital</h1><p>There is a common misunderstanding about the coming automated economy that may destroy us all. Most people in business and finance (and most people, frankly) think that the new economy (of artificial intelligence and autonomous machines) is like the old economy: satisfying customers' needs for products and services. That's just not so.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e1e29104a0c7cbde256aaf89a46b7ab7a4fb17f1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Power Suits: How Dressing For Success At Work Can Pay Off</h1><p>What does it mean to "dress for success"? Certainly not what it meant when a book by that name first came out in 1975. Now, what to wear to work is a murky area that includes a new clothing trend known as "athleisure" - workout wear that might also work for the office.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99cdd713ae9f9b7ad69fd640970ae4b804b82568.jpg"></article>]]></description>
