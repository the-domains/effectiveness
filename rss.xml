            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Confessions of a Company Without Managers (1 year later)</h1><p>One year ago our company made a bold move. We eliminated all "management" responsibilities within the team. No more bosses. No more top down decisions. No more pointing fingers. Each person became responsible for their own impact and value on the team. Each person is now responsible for any problem or opportunity they see.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/80f0a0564b9d44c2da8014be20917889908c0432.jpg"></article>]]></description>

She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn't a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a10b8c997061ec54cacf4118467c4a3f77928af3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Art of Shipping Early and Often</h1><p>"Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching: working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too many different things; excessive perfectionism. Fortunately you can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself to launch something fairly quickly."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e65e02bf3fbda6cea3d4e3203e9fb69aaee06494.png"></article>]]></description>
