One way or another, we all know, deep down, that it's simply not a functional construct, particularly in 2016. Here are five reasons why. 1.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The suddenly exciting future of enterprise communications</h1><p>Enterprise communications is not a sector that typically generates palpable excitement. In the enterprise, the plumbing is never as exciting as the fixtures, and people spend more time noticing what communications enables than how it's delivered. It doesn't help that enterprise communications is often dismissed as slow to innovate, given its high capital costs to deploy new infrastructure and natural monopolies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/33eb7c2b9ec713934d1ec8d33f6ff555aea3b1d5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Responsibility, Accountability and Levelling Up</h1><p>In hierarchical organizations, levelling up is fairly clear-it means moving up the ladder from one position to the next. Those interested in doing so have a clearer path (although it's not easy) to more responsibility. Hierarchies with lots of levels have all sorts of issues, but they do make levelling up more obvious.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9fa83aa150dfcfa29d1efae3b35c3d879147cef6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
