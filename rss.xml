            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>These Are the Most Motivational Books Ever Written</h1><p>Three years ago, I identified the " Top 10 Motivational Books of All Time," but with a twist: I left the No. 1 spot blank and asked Inc.com readers to name their favorite. In hundreds of comments, our readers named almost 300 books, but there were 18 that turned up consistently.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e4186ca1bc0da1d26fde6b279c3e50a563821012.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tips to Improve Interaction Among the Generations - Tomorrow Trends</h1><p>It seems that just about everyone is talking about generations and how to manage the mix of generations in the office these days. I was sent this interesting summary of generational values from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association Office of Diversity (USA) which was released by them in 2008.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Reasons To Kill The Work-Life Balance Myth</h1><p>Work or life? Nope. There's no such thing as either/or. The work-life duality is a fallacy. One way or another, we all know, deep down, that it's simply not a functional construct, particularly in 2016. Here are five reasons why. 1. Passion is seamless If we're engaged in our work, we're working [...]</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef45720d70bc0e79d2cd2561f804cff87dcea5a1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The suddenly exciting future of enterprise communications</h1><p>Enterprise communications is not a sector that typically generates palpable excitement. In the enterprise, the plumbing is never as exciting as the fixtures, and people spend more time noticing what communications enables than how it's delivered. It doesn't help that enterprise communications is often dismissed as slow to innovate, given its high capital costs to deploy new infrastructure and natural monopolies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/33eb7c2b9ec713934d1ec8d33f6ff555aea3b1d5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Some Corporations Hate Agile Methodologies</h1><p>Conventional business wisdom will tell us that we should tell our shareholders what they want to hear so that the price of company stock will rise.

Reid often says: If you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you've released too late.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/935af3c366ceb9e3f5a48e64587660d092bc063f.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Responsibility, Accountability and Levelling Up</h1><p>In hierarchical organizations, levelling up is fairly clear-it means moving up the ladder from one position to the next. Those interested in doing so have a clearer path (although it's not easy) to more responsibility. Hierarchies with lots of levels have all sorts of issues, but they do make levelling up more obvious.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9fa83aa150dfcfa29d1efae3b35c3d879147cef6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lean UX in the Enterprise</h1><p>I've spent the past 5 years speaking, teaching, coaching and working with teams aspiring to bring a customer-centric point of view to their product development processes. Some have seen great success. Some, despite strong desire and a willingness to adapt have struggled. The challenges the successful teams have overcome have rarely been tactical ones.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e8812ba672b15d06f9006789da08337f6e7a3969.jpg"></article>]]></description>
