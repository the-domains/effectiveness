            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The suddenly exciting future of enterprise communications</h1><p>Enterprise communications is not a sector that typically generates palpable excitement. In the enterprise, the plumbing is never as exciting as the fixtures, and people spend more time noticing what communications enables than how it's delivered. It doesn't help that enterprise communications is often dismissed as slow to innovate, given its high capital costs to deploy new infrastructure and natural monopolies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/33eb7c2b9ec713934d1ec8d33f6ff555aea3b1d5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Some Corporations Hate Agile Methodologies</h1><p>Conventional business wisdom will tell us that we should tell our shareholders what they want to hear so that the price of company stock will rise. This displaces the value that corporations will aim for toward the shareholder and not necessarily toward the customer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/00b617d5882c1e91282f6e67bb477671706c28dd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Entrepreneur's Greatest Asset: Embarrassment</h1><p>Have no shame in your game I had the opportunity to visit LinkedIn for the Speaker Series. I chatted with LinkedIn Executive Chairman and co-founder Reid Hoffman on a range of topics, including: "What should quality mean for entrepreneurs?" Reid often says: If you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you've released too late.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/935af3c366ceb9e3f5a48e64587660d092bc063f.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Responsibility, Accountability and Levelling Up</h1><p>In hierarchical organizations, levelling up is fairly clear-it means moving up the ladder from one position to the next. Those interested in doing so have a clearer path (although it's not easy) to more responsibility. Hierarchies with lots of levels have all sorts of issues, but they do make levelling up more obvious.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9fa83aa150dfcfa29d1efae3b35c3d879147cef6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lean UX in the Enterprise</h1><p>I've spent the past 5 years speaking, teaching, coaching and working with teams aspiring to bring a customer-centric point of view to their product development processes. Some have seen great success. Some, despite strong desire and a willingness to adapt have struggled. The challenges the successful teams have overcome have rarely been tactical ones.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e8812ba672b15d06f9006789da08337f6e7a3969.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Uncertainty and creativity make good company</h1><p>Certainty sounds like something rock solid and immovable - something upon which you can depend. In reality it's ephemeral. Yet human beings love the idea of certainty and when we're thrust into situations of change and uncertainty, it feels like a test. Sometimes it even feels like punishment.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/817cb3ca82605722a82dcef7b8225d913a593c21.jpg"></article>]]></description>
