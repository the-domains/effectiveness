            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The future of business is that the customer is the labor and the capital</h1><p>There is a common misunderstanding about the coming automated economy that may destroy us all. Most people in business and finance (and most people, frankly) think that the new economy (of artificial intelligence and autonomous machines) is like the old economy: satisfying customers' needs for products and services. That's just not so.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e1e29104a0c7cbde256aaf89a46b7ab7a4fb17f1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
