            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The truth about idea stealing - Crew blog</h1><p>So many of us start the new year bursting with new product and business ideas. Yet, after asking my personal network if they'd share their ideas publicly, one question kept coming up: How will I protect my idea from being stolen? Why does everyone think their ideas will be stolen?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/580551fcd398074eecaff91e89956e56145e5949.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't create a sense of urgency, foster a sense of purpose.</h1><p>Trying to create a sense of urgency almost always backfires. I lead software teams. Part of the territory is people (CEOs, stakeholders, customers) wishing we could go faster. I'm often asked - " do you think the team has a strong enough sense of urgency?" or the direct "can you make the team feel a stronger sense of urgency?"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ecf29ff7bba90a949d637c6d97679069a33887d4.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Minimum and Viable - The Corporate Startup</h1><p>Experimental and Mundane Realism The concept of the minimum viable product is now part of the popular lexicon within the lean startup movement. As with most terms that become over-used most people still misunderstand what an MVP really is. Since most people assume "lean" means cheap, they also assume the MVP means "crappy version of future product".</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0939916efbb396fbdd4a77eb24847139d4ad396c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Your Brain Actually Works Better in Winter, According to Science</h1><p>February is basically no one's favorite month. By now, most of us are well and truly sick of winter, yet winter is far from done, continuing to torture us with nose-freezing temperatures and super short days. Given how unpleasant the weather can be, it makes sense to conclude that the season is only good for ski buffs and hibernation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1aac6112b92b1b264ebce6acfab3009950438943.jpg"></article>]]></description>
