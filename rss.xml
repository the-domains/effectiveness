            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Uncertainty and creativity make good company</h1><p>Certainty sounds like something rock solid and immovable - something upon which you can depend. In reality it's ephemeral. Yet human beings love the idea of certainty and when we're thrust into situations of change and uncertainty, it feels like a test. Sometimes it even feels like punishment.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/817cb3ca82605722a82dcef7b8225d913a593c21.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Futurists say this is what offices will look like in 2030</h1><p>Watch "Mad Men" or take a look at old photos of offices of decades past and what do you notice? Things don't look all that different. Sure the gender ratio has ( hopefully!) improved, the typewriters have been replaced by computers, and open areas are no longer just for secretaries, but the basics remain the same - desks, chairs, a lunch room, conference tables and chairs, etc.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a41bae5bea188780fc928e120b25659b828ba3aa.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can agile scale and does it matter?</h1><p>Five years ago, when I visited Zappos, CEO Tony Hseih pointed out that as organizations grow they become less effective. Each person you add increases productivity by a little less than the previous employee. Eventually, a large organization takes man-years to do what a small one could do in man-weeks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e02a9d227a30e2484222e49c687634fc38ff38ee.jpg"></article>]]></description>
