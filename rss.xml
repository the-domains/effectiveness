            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stop Managing Dependencies!</h1><p>Dependencies in Software Development have been an issue since decades and lots of practices have been built to "manage" them, creating an environment that becomes more complicated with longer time-to-market times as dependencies grow (or the product/solution grows).

Luckily Scrum doesn't have many pieces: 3 roles, 3 artifacts and 5 events.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/44317344b25f871cafb8c023ef9fa798e9949898.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Growing organisational agility, navigating complexity - with Sociocracy 3.0 + Open Space</h1><p>Agile and Lean have delivered fantastic results for optimizing flow of value to customers, but sooner or later agile teams bump into limitations in the surrounding organisation.

Now these two worlds meet in a hybridised synthesis.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3c779185b70a7a5ef9d2df0bf1122beb5c9dde23.png"></article>]]></description>
