            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Entrepreneur's Greatest Asset: Embarrassment</h1><p>Have no shame in your game I had the opportunity to visit LinkedIn for the Speaker Series. I chatted with LinkedIn Executive Chairman and co-founder Reid Hoffman on a range of topics, including: "What should quality mean for entrepreneurs?" Reid often says: If you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you've released too late.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/935af3c366ceb9e3f5a48e64587660d092bc063f.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Responsibility, Accountability and Levelling Up</h1><p>In hierarchical organizations, levelling up is fairly clear-it means moving up the ladder from one position to the next. Those interested in doing so have a clearer path (although it's not easy) to more responsibility. Hierarchies with lots of levels have all sorts of issues, but they do make levelling up more obvious.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9fa83aa150dfcfa29d1efae3b35c3d879147cef6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lean UX in the Enterprise</h1><p>I've spent the past 5 years speaking, teaching, coaching and working with teams aspiring to bring a customer-centric point of view to their product development processes. Some have seen great success. Some, despite strong desire and a willingness to adapt have struggled. The challenges the successful teams have overcome have rarely been tactical ones.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e8812ba672b15d06f9006789da08337f6e7a3969.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Uncertainty and creativity make good company</h1><p>Certainty sounds like something rock solid and immovable - something upon which you can depend. In reality it's ephemeral. Yet human beings love the idea of certainty and when we're thrust into situations of change and uncertainty, it feels like a test. Sometimes it even feels like punishment.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/817cb3ca82605722a82dcef7b8225d913a593c21.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Futurists say this is what offices will look like in 2030</h1><p>Watch "Mad Men" or take a look at old photos of offices of decades past and what do you notice? Things don't look all that different. Sure the gender ratio has ( hopefully!) improved, the typewriters have been replaced by computers, and open areas are no longer just for secretaries, but the basics remain the same - desks, chairs, a lunch room, conference tables and chairs, etc.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a41bae5bea188780fc928e120b25659b828ba3aa.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can agile scale and does it matter?</h1><p>Five years ago, when I visited Zappos, CEO Tony Hseih pointed out that as organizations grow they become less effective. Each person you add increases productivity by a little less than the previous employee. Eventually, a large organization takes man-years to do what a small one could do in man-weeks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e02a9d227a30e2484222e49c687634fc38ff38ee.jpg"></article>]]></description>
