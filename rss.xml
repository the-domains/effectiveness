            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Case for Dual Innovation</h1><p>The first time I was advocating the idea of a dual innovation approach, here also referred to as organizational ambidexterity, is now more than 5 years ago. At this time it became pretty obvious to me that this concept - academically worn-out but deficiently or not at all put into practice in most organizations - would be of increasing importance in the time to come.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ba73d693e01d476d4effe20a56f02ebdfcc8a66f.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Most Productive Teams at Google Have These 5 Dynamics</h1><p>Google's People Operations department confronted a paradox. Like most HR organizations, it hired individuals. It developed individuals. It evaluated the performance of individuals. Yet almost everything Google does, it does in teams. The group started thinking, "How could HR be different if we reoriented at least some of our services toward the level of the team?"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c5f302d7b078d19207bde588ef427d4a378b4be.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Increase Your Return on Failure</h1><p>Executive Summary Although many companies claim to embrace failure as an integral part of the innovation process, near-zero tolerance for it blocks them from pursuing new ideas. Corporate budgeting, resource allocation, and risk control are all designed to promote predictability and efficiency, and even when people understand that they can and should fail, they do everything possible to avoid missteps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8667a74c1918b9e0dc04e6dd30b6d801950cd2fe.jpg"></article>]]></description>
