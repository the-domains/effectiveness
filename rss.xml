            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Power Suits: How Dressing For Success At Work Can Pay Off</h1><p>What does it mean to "dress for success"? Certainly not what it meant when a book by that name first came out in 1975. Now, what to wear to work is a murky area that includes a new clothing trend known as "athleisure" - workout wear that might also work for the office.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99cdd713ae9f9b7ad69fd640970ae4b804b82568.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The suddenly exciting future of enterprise communications</h1><p>Enterprise communications is not a sector that typically generates palpable excitement. In the enterprise, the plumbing is never as exciting as the fixtures, and people spend more time noticing what communications enables than how it's delivered.
