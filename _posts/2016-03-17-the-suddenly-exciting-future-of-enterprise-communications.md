    description: "George Bernard Shaw pointed out, \"The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.\" So often, people just assume that their efforts in communication have been well received or received at all.

description: "Enterprise communications is not a sector that typically generates palpable excitement. In the enterprise, the plumbing is never as exciting as the fixtures, and people spend more time noticing what communications enables than how it's delivered. It doesn't help that enterprise communications is often dismissed as slow to innovate, given its high capital costs to deploy new infrastructure and natural monopolies."
