description: 'A Market Risk R&D Lab At Leancamp Stuttgart, we had a number of interesting sessions. One session in particular focused on corporate accelerators as a means to help large enterprises develop innovative new products. A corporate accelerator would be similar to other accelerator programmes such as Y-Combinator and Tech Stars.'
