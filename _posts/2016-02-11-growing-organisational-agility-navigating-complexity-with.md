description: 'Agile and Lean have delivered fantastic results for optimizing flow of value to customers, but sooner or later agile teams bump into limitations in the surrounding organisation. Classic sociocracy has delivered fantastic results for improving organisational governance, enabling dynamic steering and generating cross organisational collaboration, yet until recently has been applied predominantly within traditional organisational systems. Now these two worlds meet in a hybridised synthesis.'
